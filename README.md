# ESE-345-Project-Part-1
A Multi Media ALU that takes in 3 128 bit inputs and gives out 1 128 bit inputs. Each 128 bit is broken into either 4 32 bits or 2 62 bits, with the high and low being the upper and lower respectively. There is a 25 bit select input that isn't expixitly designed but must be accounted for in choinisg the arithmetic logic

# ESE-345-Project-Part-1
A Multi-Media ALU that takes in 3 128-bit inputs and gives out 1 128-bit output. Each 128-bit is broken into either 4 32-bits or 2 64-bits, with the high and low being the upper and lower respectively. There is a 25-bit select input that isn't explicitly designed but must be accounted for in choosing the arithmetic logic.
